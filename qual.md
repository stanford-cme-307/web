This course serves as foundational material for the qualifying exam for CME PhD students and OIT PhD students. Information on both of these exams will be collected here.

# CME 307 qualifying exam

ICME PhD candidates are required to take a qualifying exam on the material from CME 307. The exam will be held at the end of Spring quarter and will be similar in format to the CME 307 final exam: 

- 90 minutes
- closed book, but one page of notes, double side, standard 8.5x11 printer paper is allowed

To study, try looking through the lectures slides and homework, and making a sheet of notes summarizing important concepts and ideas. What are the main principles? You might also try doing some homework from this year or previous years to sharpen your linear algebra skills, which come in handy for writing down results in optimization! If you have more time, it's great practice to make up problems and work on them with friends.
