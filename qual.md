ICME PhD candidates are required to take a qualifying exam on the material from CME 307. This exam will be similar in format to the CME 307 final exam: 

- 90 minutes
- closed book, but one page of notes, double side, standard 8.5x11 printer paper is allowed

To study, I recommend looking through the lectures slides and homework, and making a sheet of notes summarizing important concepts and ideas. What are the main principles? You might also try doing some homework from this year or previous years to sharpen your linear algebra skills, which come in handy for writing down results in optimization! If you have more time, it's great practice to make up problems and work on them with friends.

## Previous qualifying exams and final exams

You may find previous qualifying and final exams useful for your studying, though course topics may shift from year to year, so don't worry if questions seem unfamiliar!
