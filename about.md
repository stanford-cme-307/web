## Course description and prerequisites

An optimizer seeks to identify the decisions that will maximize their objectives
while satisfying constraints, with applications across engineering, 
business, economics, statistics, data analysis, 
and everyday life. 
Through this course, students will learn to formulate and solve real-world problems using modern optimization
and the fundamental analysis required to develop new algorithms for 
new problems.
We formalize optimization problems, in particular considering their 
size, sparsity, discrete variables, convexity, ill-conditioning, access patterns to problem data, convergence tolerance, and speed,
and introduce algorithmic paradigms including linear systems,
first and second order methods, 
preconditioning, stochastic optimization, and integer programming.
<!-- 
Applications, theories, and algorithms for finite-dimensional linear and nonlinear optimization problems with continuous and discrete variables. 
Elements of convex analysis, first- and second-order optimality conditions, sensitivity and duality. 
Algorithms for unconstrained optimization, and linearly and nonlinearly constrained problems. 
Modern applications in data analysis, machine learning, engineering system design, communications, game theory, auctions, and economics. -->

This course is required for ICME PhD students. 
PhD students from other disciplines seeking to use optimization in their research or perform optimization research, 
ambitious ICME masters students, 
or advanced undergraduates in mathematics, computer science, statistics, and related fields, are also welcome.

Prerequisites:
- Math 113 (linear algebra) and 115 (calculus), or equivalent
- fluency in proof-based mathematics

## Course learning goals

<!-- Big dream: students should be able to formulate and solve real-world problems using modern optimization. -->

Through active engagement and completion of course activities, you will be able to:
<!-- * recognize that every problem is an optimization problem. -->
* formulate real-world problems as optimization problems.
* identify appropriate solvers and explain tradeoffs in the context of a real world problem, considering features including size, sparsity, discrete variables, convexity, ill-conditioning, access patterns to problem data, convergence tolerance, and speed.
* tweak optimization algorithms to adapt them to a specific problem.
* assess new optimization papers for their relevance to a given problem.
* develop confidence as an optimizer by designing a solution to an optimization problem, including selecting methodology, writing code, and presenting results.

## Computing environment

We will be using the Julia programming language via Pluto notebooks for in-class demos.
Most optimization solvers are easy to access and swap out from within the Julia ecosystem,
and Julia code is both simple to write and fast to run.
Pluto notebooks allow for better interactivity and reactivity
and are easy to install and use.
[Learn how to install and use Pluto notebooks.](https://plutojl.org/)

Students may use any language they wish (and that the course staff can read) to complete homework assignments and projects.

## Access and accommodations

Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. 

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services, please visit [oae.stanford.edu](https://oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience of this course.

## Diversity statement

It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. We aim to present materials and conduct activities in ways that are respectful of this diversity. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know if you have ideas to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
