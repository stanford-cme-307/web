Why nonconvex? Why now?

It's gotten much better since 2004...

* MILP Solvers 
    * hardware
    * software
* Deep learning
    * overparametrization
    * if training loss is 0 you're at a global minimum!
* Manifold optimization
    * benign geometry

If you've got a complex nonlinear integer program, what parts of the problem are the right part to relax?
