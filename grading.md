## Course grading scheme

The course grading scheme is designed to encourage students to keep up with
the course content as it happens, and to join lectures in person if they're able.

- **Homework (35%):** three (or so) homework assignments
- **Project (60%):** two projects
- **Participation (5%):** students are expected to attend lecture, ask questions, and engage in discussion
- (optional) **Exam (30%):** can replace the second project

These weights are approximate; we reserve the right to change them later.

More details about each assignment follow.

## Homework

Homework will be submitted on Gradescope.

*Slip days.* We recognize that students are balancing many priorities,
and so we make accommodations to allow for late homework.
Students have 5 slip days that may be used through the quarter with no grade penalty.
At most 3 slip days may be used for a single assignment.
For example, you could submit one homework three days late and a second two days late.
To calculate slip days, we round up: a homework submitted 24 hours and one minute after it is due will use two slip days.
Homework submitted after all your slip days are used will receive a score of 0.

*Regrades.* You can ask for your homework to be regraded up until two days after grades have been posted.
Regrades can increase or decrease your grade.
(We will regrade the whole assignment, not just a single question.)

*Weights.* Although some assignments are more difficult than others,
we weight all assignments equally when computing your overall homework score.

*Collaboration.* The goal of the homework is to help you practice the skills that you'll use later in this class and - we hope! - later in life.
Homework carries weight for your grade to encourage you to spend time on it and think deeply about it.
Our collaboration policy is geared to make sure you can get the help you need,
and so that by the time you turn in your work you understand what it's about,
how it works, and why it's important.

Students are allowed - and even encouraged - to collaborate on homework.
However, each student must submit their own homework. We ask that you

- Give credit to the people who have helped you: please write on your homework the names of the people you worked with.
- Give credit to the other resources that have helped you: please write on your homework 
the textbooks, notes, web pages, or large language models you found useful.
- Write up your homework by yourself. 
That is, all of the text that you submit should be typed or hand-written by you.
No copy-pasting.

*Partial credit.* If you're not able to answer a homework question, but you show us
the work that you performed to think about the question and to try to understand it,
you will receive partial credit.

*Sharing solutions.* 
Under no circumstance should you seek out or look at solutions to assignments given in previous years,
or share or post solutions (yours or ours) to a public website.

## Projects

The first project for the course will require you to implement an optimization algorithm 
(from class, or another that you are interested in),
try it out on a few problems, and write a report about your experience.
You may implement in any language you like, although we recommend using Julia.
The algorithm implementation must be completed individually by every student,
following the same collaboration policy as for the homework.

The second project may be a repeat of the first (using another algorithm), 
or it can be a research project to be chosen in consultation with the course staff.
The research project option is intended for PhD students to align your work on the class 
with your longer term research objectives.
The research project may be done as a small group (1-3 people).
<!-- https://info.catme.org/ -->
Come chat with any of the course staff during our office hours to clear your project with us.

You will submit your project reports as a pdf or as a jupyter or pluto notebook.
We may share projects with other students enrolled in the class. 
If you need to keep your project private, please speak with an instructor.

Additionally, students submitting research projects will present on their work in class.
[Sign up for a slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PXv_sFkhz5jNAA765kgHanSPoILm2fHzzRNuOOJzpHM/edit?usp=sharing)
on the project presentations tab, particularly if you plan to leave campus early.
It is possible to present project remotely by prior permission of the instructor.

## Exams

Optionally, students can choose to take an exam rather than submit the second project.
We will provide more details about the exam later in the quarter.
It will probably be scheduled in person during the exam period.

## Exceptions

Beyond the slip days and drops outlined above,
extensions on assignments will be granted only 
with an academic accommodation letter from the Office of Accessible Education
(generally for medical reasons).
or in other such exceptional circumstances.
Requests due to job interviews, other classes and assignments, and poor planning will not be considered.
We suggest you save your slip days to insure against catastrophe.

## Participation

Students are expected to attend class and actively participate in discussion.
We may fall back to more formal grading for participation to encourage attendance, 
but expect to treat it informally in 2023.
