The course schedule and links to surveys, resources, and supplementary materials are posted [on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15KZyWinDcj--XBpuG229Ani2FfWezeYhPUMIoE0aeq0/edit?usp=sharing).

Slides will be posted below before each lecture, and notes afterwards.
The quizzes and tests will be based solely on the lecture, slides, and notes;
other readings listed on the spreadsheet will aid your understanding but 
are not required.

<!-- Class sessions will be a combination of mini-lectures and small group breakout sessions where you will discuss, solve problems, and complete activities with a few of your classmates.
Since class sessions will be highly interactive, they will not be recorded.
Slides will sometimes be posted.  -->
